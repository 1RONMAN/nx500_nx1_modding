How to install:

		  1) start with a clean memory card (no files), turn on your Bluetooth
		  2) unzip the contents of the zip into the root of the sdcard
		  3) put the card in the camera, and re/start the camera
		  4) have some patience (there can be 1 or 2 auto-reboots)
		  5) when BG-mod is complete there will be [ Installation Complete ] message, followed by reboot
		  6) after boot, you will see [ Mod V1.xx ] (if you don't see it in 15 seconds, turn on the Bluetooth)
		  x) to uninstall the BT-mod - select: main menu > settings> Uninstall Mod



Details on the installation process:

Make sure you have turned on your Bluetooth before installing. After inserting the sdcard with the unplacked files from the zip, and starting the camera, initially we start in "factory mode", the script checks for BT-patch, and if one is detected it will be unintalled automatically. Follows automatic restart,  after which the BT-mod is installed automatically (making sure it is the proper version). Another reboot follows. After the Mod script gets loaded, and bitrates get customized, you will see a message similar to " [ Mod V1.xx ] ". If you don't see this message, the script did not start, and your Blutooth is probably "off". Turn it "on", and the script will start (you don't need to turn on BT each time the camera starts). If you need to use Bluetooth, you can start it from the "settings" menu.

Thanks to Otto for the programs that make this possible - keyscan, gui, poker, focus stacking, focus buttons, .. to name a few
Thanks to Vasile for coming up with the values for the bitrate-change and nx500's 2.5K mod
