How to install:

		  1) start with a clean memory card (no files), turn on your Bluetooth
		  2) unzip the contents of the zip into the root of the sdcard
		  3) put the card in the camera, and re/start the camera
		  4) If you already have had installed BT-mod, you have an option to Reinstall it (reboot follows)
		  5) You will be asked if you want to keep Bluetooth-ON or permanently keep it OFF (reboot follows)
		  6) booting you will see [ Mod V1.xx ] (if you don't see it in 15 seconds, turn on the Bluetooth)
		  x) to uninstall the BT-mod - select: main menu > settings> Uninstall Mod



Details on the installation process:

After inserting the sdcard with the file, and starting the camera, initially we start in "factory mode", the script check for BT-patch, and if one is detected you will have the option to reinstall it or to keep it. If you want to keep it the camera auto-restarts and you will see a message [ Mod v.1.xx ] indicating that the mod is running. If you want to reinstall it, uninstallation will be done, and reboot will follow. If you have just uninstalled BT-mod, or you have never installed it, you will have a choice - to install it with Bluetooth ON or to have it permanently OFF. If you chose to have it ON, you will be able to use Bluetooth functionality, however it will be ON all the time you use the mod-scripts. If you chose to have it OFF, you won't be able to use it, but only the mod-scripts will be running. After restart the Mod script gets loaded, and bitrates get customized. You will see a message similar to " [ Mod V1.xx ] " once the bitrates are patched. If you don't see this message, the script did not start, and your Blutooth is probably "off". Turn it "on", and the script will start (you don't need to turn on BT each time the camera starts). This version ot BT-mod disables the actual Bluetooth, so in case you need it working, please install the BT mod that comes with Vasile's zip for bitrate-mod. You do not need to Uninstall previous versions of the BT-mod installed from this pack. However should you choose to do it, you can always Uninstall your BT-mod from the menu, reinstallation however will require you put again the full zip contents in the root folder of the sdcard.
